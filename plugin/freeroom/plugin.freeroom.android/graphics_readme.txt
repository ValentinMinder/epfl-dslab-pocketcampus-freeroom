FreeRoom - Graphical lines
Author: Valentin Minder

Most of the icons used in this plugin come from the LEGACY ANDROID 4.4 ACTION BAR icons set, downloaded from http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html
The full set used is committed in the “graphic” folder (pocketcampus/graphics/android)
All the icon coming from this package are named ic_action_xyz.png and in format mdpi (32x32px), hdpi (48x48px), xhpdi (64x64px) and xxhpdi (92x92px). ldli (24x24) seems to be automatically down sampled from hdpi, as xxxhpdi is not provided. 
- Some android icons are reused with a different name. For example, ic_action_favorite_disabled is originally ic_action_non_important, but the rename was done to precise for what is was used.
- Some are white coming from the holo-dark package, as others come from the holo-light and are grey. Please be aware that depending on where you are using them, you should one to the other version, to be consistent with android styles.

Some icons are also HOME-MADE. This concernes the occupancy icons, the traffic lights icons and the disabled share button. These icons have been created on 192x192 or 256x256 assets, then downsampled to ALL the formats, including ldpi and xxxhdpi. The originals as well as the pieces needed to construct them could be found in the graphics folder (pocketcampus/graphics/freeroom). These icons are not android specific and may be used by other platform, downsampled to the needed format from the original files.
