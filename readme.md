## Build instructions

The server and the Android projects are built with Gradle.  
To build the entire server, use `gradlew server:build`.  
To make a JAR with the server, use `gradlew server:shadowJar`, which creates a JAR in build/libs/.  
To merge all Android projects, use `gradlew android:merge`, which creates a project in android/ that you can then build like a normal Android project, e.g. `gradlew android:assembleDebug` and `gradlew android:assembleRelease` to assemble debug and release versions respectively.

The iOS client and Windows Phone clients are built with Xcode and Visual Studio respectively.

## Other tasks

Take a look at the readme/ folder for detailed instructions on various subjects, such as adding a new plugin.
