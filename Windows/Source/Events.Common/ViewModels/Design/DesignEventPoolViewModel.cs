<strong>Abstract </strong>:
<br />
<br /> Resource value is among the most debated concepts in the resource-based theory. In this paper, we test recent arguments that resource value is a function of a resource’s ex ante standalone value, the presence of complementary resources, and demand-side factors using a dataset of all patents filed by the 33 largest pharmaceutical corporations in the US market during 1980-1985.&nbsp; In line with our predictions, we find a positive direct effect of standalone technological value of a new patented molecule. We further find that the level of demand and the firm’s position in the therapeutic class positively moderate the influence of a patented molecules standalone value on the likelihood of that molecule being further developed through clinical trials. Contrary to our predictions, we find that scientific and technological strength negatively moderate this relationship, a finding that suggests negative complementarity in the form of increased selectiveness in further developing molecules into drugs.",

In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection – imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity?map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection.&nbsp; This talk will review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, with particular reference to the PImMS (Pixel Imaging Mass Spectrometry) sensors developed in Oxford, and will showcase results from a range of different imaging applications.",

We also found changes in synaptic markers and in brain fatty acid profiles in mice fed a high-fat diet.

<br /> The quantification of root reinforcement represents a key issue in different area of engineering (slope stability, soil protection, silviculture/tree stability, hydraulic).&nbsp; Between all the effects of plants on the physical and chemical soil processes (direct and indirect), the mechanical effect of roots is considered particularly important for slope stability. The study of root reinforcement is faced with the high complexity of interactions of processes and factors at different spatial-temporal scales. In particular, the hierarchical spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and its effects on soil processes represents a big challenge for quantitative up-scaling methods. The objective of this seminar is to contextualize the complexity of the root-soil interactions in view of slope stability problems, to review the recent scientific contributions in the quantification of root reinforcement, and to discuss the practical meaning of recent research results.
<br /> The presentation follows the central theme of an up-scaling framework for the implementation of root reinforcement in slope stability analysis, discussing specific topics such as pullout force of single roots, root bundle mechanics, spatial heterogeneity of root distribution, and triggering mechanism of shallow landslides. The above-mentioned factors and processes build up the modules implemented in a numerical model for slope stability calculations, the SOSlope model . The results of simulations performed with the SOSlope model serve as background for the discussion on the role of root reinforcement for protection forests management and bioengineering applications.

<u>Short biography</u>:
<br /> With a master thesis on bioengineering at the SLF in Davos, Massimiliano Schwarz graduated in Forest engineering at the University of Florence (IT). After a short experience in the practice in the canton of Grisons (Zuoz, CH), he started a PhD at the WSL on the &quot;Hydro-mechanical characterization of rooted hillslope failure: from field investigations to fiber bundle modeling&quot;, associated to the doctoral schools at both EPFL and ETHZ.
<br /> In 2010, Dr Schwarz started a part-time activity as lecturer and scientific collaborator at the Bern University of Applied Sciences, and as a visiting scientific at the WSL.
<br />
<br /> His professional interest is oriented on different issues related to landscape and resources management in mountain regions. In particular, his research focuses on the quantification of the interaction between vegetation and hydro-mechanical processes at different temporal and spatial scales. His teaching activity at the University of Applied Sciences in Bern covers the topics of bioengineering, natural hazards (landslides, debris flow, and floods), and pedology.",

Most remarkably, the application of stress can dramatically harden the material, transforming it from a liquid state at rest into a solid-like state when driven strongly.&nbsp; Shear-thickening-based models developed over the last 25 years cannot explain the observed large normal stresses (large enough to support a grown person's weight when running across a pool filled with a suspension such as cornstarch in water). This talk surveys some of the key issues, discusses the stress scales associated with shear thickening in dense suspensions, and outlines a new scenario for impact response.&nbsp; In particular, using high-speed video and x-ray imaging during sudden impact, we are able to link the nonlinear suspension dynamics in a new way to the jamming phase transition.

Furthermore, this dielectric response deviates from the ``traditional'' Curie-Weiss law [22] for temperatures lower than the so-called Burns temperature [2]. Other examples of anomalous properties include the plateau observed&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; static,&nbsp; dc&nbsp; dielectric&nbsp; response&nbsp; at&nbsp; low&nbsp; temperature&nbsp; [23,24],&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; unusual&nbsp; temperature behavior [16] of the Edwards-Anderson parameter [25]. Determining the origin of these intriguing effects has been a challenge to scientists for more than half a century. Moreover, many other questions remain opened for discussion.&nbsp; Examples&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; questions&nbsp; are:&nbsp; what&nbsp; do&nbsp; the&nbsp; different&nbsp; critical&nbsp; temperatures&nbsp; usually&nbsp; found&nbsp; in relaxors&nbsp; correspond&nbsp; to?&nbsp; Do&nbsp; polar&nbsp; nanoregions&nbsp; really&nbsp; exist&nbsp; in&nbsp; relaxors?&nbsp; If&nbsp; yes,&nbsp; do&nbsp; they&nbsp; only&nbsp; form&nbsp; inside chemically-ordered regions? Is it necessary that antiferroelectricity develops in order for the relaxor behavior to occur? Are random fields and random strains really the mechanisms responsible for relaxor behavior? If not, what are these mechanisms?
<br />
<br /> Motivated to resolve such questions and to better understand relaxors, we decided to study disordered Ba(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3&nbsp; (BZT) solid solutions, via the development and use of a first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian. Note that BZT is also fascinating because, in addition to be a relaxor within some compositional range, its parent compounds are rather different, namely BaZrO3 is paraelectric while BaTiO3 is a typical ferroelectric.
<br />
<br /> Interestingly,&nbsp; our ab-initio-based&nbsp; calculations&nbsp; not only reproduce&nbsp; the anomalous&nbsp; features of relaxors but also offer a deep microscopic insight into BZT [26,27,28]. Such insight allows to successfully answer the aforementioned questions, and will be discussed in detail during this talk.

<br /> Methane is about 22 times stronger than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and has been accumulated strongly in the atmosphere during the last decades. However, emissions from aquatic systems in Switzerland are not well constrained. We have investigated several lakes and reservoirs in Switzerland and I will show some results of this research. The main topic is how to constrain methane oxidation in freshwater systems. From the ocean we know that most of the methane formed in the sea floor is anaerobically oxidized via sulfate already in the sediments and/or later in the water column. In lakes sulfate concentrations are low and methane could be oxidized either aerobically with oxygen or anaerobically via other electron acceptors (nitrate, iron, manganese). I will show data from freshwater systems in Switzerland to demonstrate how methane is transformed into carbon dioxide using mainly isotopic, mass spectrometer, and incubation methods.

<u>Short biography</u>:
<br /> Carsten Schubert is a biogeochemist with a strong expertise in stable isotope geochemistry, organic geochemistry and biogeochemistry. He traces biogeochemical processes and interactions in marine and lacustrine sediments and water bodies. His research has led to over 75 publications. Through the analysis of specific biomarkers (both concentration and isotopic composition) in water column and sediments it was possible to study phytoplankton community structures, demonstrate that CH4 is actively consumed under anaerobic conditions, showthe first conclusive evidence for anammox in a lacustrine system (Lake Tanganyika) or reconstructocean currents off Newfoundland using 15N of amino acids in deep sea corals. Most recently, methane emissions were determined from lakes, reservoirs and rivers; processes related to methane oxidation in the water column of Lake&nbsp; Kivu, several Swiss lakes and in the Arctic Tundra was investigated, finally we work on the degradation/preservation of amino acids and amino sugars in Swiss lakes.

However, in spite of decades of research, the origin of this viscous behavior still remains unclear. Here we use the indentation technique to study this creep of cementitious materials over a variety of length scales. The indentation technique is a handy contact mechanical test that consists in pushing a probe of known geometry and mechanical properties onto the surface of the material to be tested and enables to measure -- among others -- the creep properties of the indented material. We compare minutes-long microindentation creep experiments on cement paste with years-long macroscopic uniaxial creep experiments on concrete: we thus show that the indentation technique enables to measure the rate of long-term creep of cementitious materials orders of magnitude faster than conventional macroscopic testing. We also apply nanoindentation to measure the creep properties of micrometric phases of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), which are the 'glue' of cement paste and are mostly responsible for the viscous behavior of this latter: this study and an analogy with the viscous behavior of soils serve as a basis to discuss the origin of creep.&nbsp;

<strong>Abstract</strong>:
<br /> Collaboration matters in science.&nbsp; Yet, while there is intriguing evidence that the organization of scientific collaboration is changing, and that teams are becoming more important, the analysis has been mostly based on studying the results of collaborations as evidenced by co-authorship of publications or patents at the scientist level . There are a number of unanswered questions about the structure of the fundamental unit of scientific production: the project team.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who works on scientific teams?&nbsp; What is the role of postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students? How do scientific networks of collaboration evolve in response to federal funding decisions? And how do different network structures affect scientific productivity, in both creation of knowledge and diffusion of results?&nbsp; Answering these questions is of fundamental national interest. The federal government invests more than $140 billion annually in basic and applied research.&nbsp; Businesses investment approximately twice that.&nbsp; Yet the way in which these investments work their way through to affecting innovation, economic growth and social well-being remains largely a black box, because so little is known about the project teams that are the fundamental building block of research and development activity. We contribute to the literature by using new longitudinal data derived from the STAR METRICS program to examine a new level of analysis in depth: the structure of scientific collaboration and the use of scientific equipment at the project level and the effect on subsequent outcomes.

<br /> The massive soil CO2 efflux associated with rewetting dry soils after the dry summer period significantly contributes to the annual carbon budget of Mediterranean grasslands. Better understanding i) soil microbial adaptation strategies to a seasonally contrasted climate and ii) the response of microorganisms to altered summer precipitation is important to predict future changes in carbon cycling in Mediterranean grasslands. These two axes of research were tackled in both present (DNA-based) and potentially active (rRNA-based) soil bacterial and fungal communities, by sequencing phylogenetic marker genes and quantifying the abundance of these genes and transcripts.
<br />
<br /> How do soil microorganisms respond to extreme desiccation and rewetting? In three California annual grasslands, soil microbial communities were tracked over a summer season, and in response to controlled rewetting of intact soil cores. Contrasting desiccation-related bacterial life-strategies that were consistent across sites suggest that predicted changes in precipitation patterns may affect soil nutrient and carbon cycling by differentially impacting activity patterns of microbial communities.
<br />
<br /> How do changes in summer precipitation pattern affect soil microbial response to fall wet-up? Intact soil cores were subjected to three different precipitation patterns over four months (full summer dry season, extended wet season, and absent summer dry season), then the effects of a controlled rewetting event on the soil CO2 efflux pulse and on soil microbial communities were investigated. We found a strong, significant positive relation between change in the structure of the potentially active bacterial community and the magnitude of the CO2 pulse upon rewetting dry soils. We suggest that the duration of severe dry conditions may be important in conditioning the response of the potentially active bacterial community to wet-up and in controlling the magnitude of the CO2 pulse resulting from wet-up events. Thus, predicted changes in summer precipitation pattern may likely affect the metabolic potential of the soil bacterial community and the related magnitude of the rainfall-induced CO2 pulse upon rewetting.

<u>Short biography</u>
<br /> As&nbsp; a functional ecologist, Romain Barnard investigates the response of terrestrial ecosystem functioning to global change. His research activities are directed towards better understanding the responses of soil C and N cycles in relation to plant physiology. After a Ph.D. at Paris-Sud University on the effects of elevated CO2 on soil nitrogen cycling, he worked at ETH Z&uuml;rich for six years in Nina Buchmann’s lab, using stable isotopes to study the controls of time-lags between the assimilation of carbon by the plant and its respiration by the soil. More microbiological aspects of the effects of changes in precipitation patterns on ecosystem functioning were later developed during a two-year stay at University of California, Berkeley in Mary Firestone’s lab. He is now a research scientist at the INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research) in Dijon, where he focuses on the effects of precipitation patterns on plant-soil interactions.",

In particular, artifacts related to the use of lab tomographs are discussed.
<br /> For a tensile test of cracked cast iron sample imaged by XRCMT, a fully coupled experimental / numerical procedure is based on an enriched kinematic basis as in eXtended finite element analyses.&nbsp; The crack surface, crack front, and stress intensity factor profiles are extracted from the measured displacements and compared with numerical predictions.&nbsp; It is also possible to evaluate local crack propagation features by analyzing different propagation steps.&nbsp; This type of analysis shows that there are direct ways to bridge the gap between experiments and simulations thanks to consistent kinematic bases and identification procedures, and opens the way for the validation of fracture laws and numerical models.",

They are designed to have high corrosion resistance in order to remain permanently in the body, as e.g. metallic stents in vascular intervention; or they must be removed in a second surgery, as e.g. metallic screws and plates in broken bone fixation. Permanent implants often generate problems such as prolonged physical irritation and chronic inflammation, and can only be applied in pediatric surgery to a limited extent because they do not grow with the patient. To overcome the limitations&nbsp;of permanent devices we have developed new classes of biodegradable metallic alloys which&nbsp;degrade in the body after performing their task. I will describe our efforts in the development of amorphous and crystalline Mg-&shy;?alloys, based on metal physical design rules, and present their mechanical properties, in-&shy;?vitro and in-&shy;?vivo degradation performance, and biological response [1-&shy;?3]. MgZnCa alloys in particular are suitable for use as biodegradable implants because they have suitable mechanical properties, are biocompatible, show good osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity, and exhibit adjustable degradation rates.

<br /> About Mark Mitton:
<br />
<br /> Mark Mitton is a world-famous professional magician who is fascinated by using magic to better understand how we see the world. For the past 25 years, Mitton has not only been dazzling audiences with his amazing skills, but has also been involved in investigating magic’s connections with psychology, biology, neurology, and philosophy. A proponent of the renowned cognitive psychologist Urich Neisser and apprentice to the famous magician magician Slydini, Mitton is just as eager to engage with psychologists and neuroscientists as he is to perform mind-bending feats of physical misdirection. He has co-organized and/or participated in a number of meetings with leading cognitive psychologists (Eldar Shafir, Joseph LeDoux, Nicholas Turk-Brown, and others) around the theme of mind and magic. Mitton has also entertained at private events of Beyonce and Sting,&nbsp; done opening acts for Aerosmith, made Will Smith appear in the middle of Times Square, taught sleight of hand to John Travolta and Stanley Tucci, worked with the biologist and Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman,&nbsp; performed in honor of Frank Yang, and recently moderated a panel of art restorers and criminal investigators who were addressing the theme of fraud, forgery, illusion, and the counterfeit.

<br /> The approach is strategic. It views systems management as a dynamic process in which designers necessarily add or change capacities and capabilities over time. As in chess, the key to success lies in positioning the system to provide valuable options. Flexibility in design is most desirable when the future is most uncertain, exactly when options are most valuable.
<br /> Flexibility in Design contrasts with Robust design. Rather than minimize the variation of future system performance, Flexibility in Design redistributes the variation in performance, reducing the downside possibilities while maximizing upside potential.
<br /> The presentation outlines the process of achieving Flexible Designs, and demonstrates its operation and value through examples. The analysis maximizes overall expected system value. It starts with explicit recognition of underlying uncertainties – in sharp contrast to conventional systems design based on fixed system requirements.&nbsp; The process explores the distribution of possible outcomes associated with alternative design concepts, generally by Monte Carlo simulations.
<br /> Example applications indicate that Flexibility in Design routinely leads to 10 to 30% increases in expected value. The intuition is that it guards against the highest risks (a win), enables taking advantage of new opportunities (more win), while frequently reducing immediate capital costs (by deferring decisions on capacity and function).&nbsp; The net effect in general is: more wins at lower cost!
<br />
<br /> Bio: Dr. Richard de Neufville is Professor of Engineering Systems and of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT. He specializes in Systems Analysis and Design of major infrastructure. His work now focuses on flexibility in technological systems. This is logically equivalent to using “real options”, but in engineering the analysis differs substantially from that of financial options. This approach implies a fundamental shift in engineering design, from a focus on fixed specifications, to a concern with system performance under the range of possible risks and opportunities. He has worked widely – geographically and substantively -- on many projects, including hydropower, oil platforms, copper mines, and his substantive specialty, airports. He is author of Flexibility in Engineering Design (MIT Press, 2011), Airport Systems Planning, Design and Management, (McGraw-Hill, 2nd edition, 2013); Applied Systems Analysis (McGraw-Hill) and other texts. Numerous prizes have recognized his work, including the Sizer Award for the Most Significant Contribution to MIT Education for having founded and led the MIT Technology and Policy Program. He has an MIT PhD and a Delft Dr.Hc. Born in the United States, he enjoyed 7 years of school in Switzerland.",

On-chip multi- and many-core systems embedding up to hundreds of heterogeneous cores are nowadays a reality. Other paradigms such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Autonomous Sensor Networks and Swarms may foster as yet unforeseen applications, by providing ubiquitous, distributed sensing, processing, communication, and actuation. Smart medical devices, smart houses, intelligent environmental and energy monitoring, intelligent transportation, social networks, interconnected together and interacting with each other may soon become standard applications governing our lives. The potential economical and societal impact of such systems is huge, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology.
<br />
<br /> The past 10 years of my research cover advances on embedded many-core systems. Specifically, system-level design strategies for specifying, analyzing, and optimizing such complex distributed systems were investigated. The key challenge is how to effectively exploit the entire available computational power, and optimize together timing, temperature, and power consumption objectives. Two main aspects were considered (1) when hardware parallelism cannot be fully exploited due to unpredictable, dynamic applications competing for resources or due to a sub-optimal mapping caused by the huge dimensionality of the design space and (2) when computational power does not necessarily translate into high performance as the system runs into the thermal wall. The presentation will answer to these two challenges and will present practical implications when integrating the proposed aspects in a complete and automatic system-level design flow, namely the Distributed Application Layer (
<a href=""http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~euretile"">http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~euretile</a>) that we have developed at ETH Z&uuml;rich.

The rest of the talk focuses on how context can be leveraged to enhance the system operation.&nbsp; Context is defined as any relevant information that provides a value-add to improving energy efficiency. Source-side context, in the form of environmental variables, can help predict solar and wind output, while load-side context, such as workload analysis and prediction, can tailor the load to accommodate the energy source variability. We show how we can leverage context in two applications: data centers and individual residences with on-site renewables and distributed energy storage. By applying context data to automation, prediction, and smart scheduling, we demonstrate over 90% improvement in green energy efficiency for data centers, and over 40% improvement in green energy costs in residences when compared with using no context.

<br /> Acidic in situ mining of uranium is used increasinglyin the deserts of Central Asia (e.g., Mongolia, Kazakhstan) in order to supply the world with sufficient uranium for energy generation. Acid is injected into the subsurface and allows rapid recovery of uranium. But, what happens to the acid after mining stops? We investigate the environmental processes that affect the mobilityof the resulting acidic plume, and will determine the legacy of in situ mining. The native microbialcommunities, associated with the ore body, will undergo changes during acid mining which may affect the eventual pH and Eh restoration and subsequent immobilization of uranium. Therefore, the broad objectives of this study are: 1) to determine how the acid affects the Kazakh aquifer, 2) to determine what microbial communities exist pre-, during-, and post-mining, and 3) to determine possible strategies to enhance environmental restoration.

<strong>Abstract:</strong>
<br /> Inflammation is an essential biological response that is required for tissue homeostasis after injury or infection. Chronic inflammation however is destructive, can lead to tissue damage, and is a hallmark of many diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. New potential therapeutic targets in addressing diseases associated with unresolved inflammation and their underlying mechanisms are now being investigated and understood, making therapeutics which dampen inflammation and enhance resolution of considerable interest -&nbsp; in particular those which can achieve this in a controlled manner with minimal host collateral damage.
<br /> Nanomedicine encompasses a multidisciplinary approach to drug delivery and has been driven in large part by discoveries in nanomaterials design and engineering, which have enabled the accomplishment of the following milestones: 1) development of biodegradable nanocarriers for the delivery of molecules of various sizes and solubilities, in sufficient loading amounts for therapeutic efficacy, 2) selective accumulation of therapeutics at disease sites and improved drug pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and degradation profiles due to careful optimization and engineering of nanoparticle biophysicochemical properties, 3) the ability to target any disease at the organ, tissue, cellular and sub-cellular levels, and 4) emerging clinical successes spanning a 40 year period.
<br /> This talk will present investigations into the development of targeted anti-inflammatory controlled-release polymeric nanomedicines for the treatment of inflammation driven diseases including atherosclerosis and colitis. The synthesis, nanoengineering, characterization and 
<em>in vivo</em> biological investigations of polymeric nanoparticles containing a payload of biologic drugs including a potent mediator biomimetic peptide and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 will be presented.",

<strong>Abstract</strong>
<br />
<br /> The proliferation of user-generated content on the web provides a wealth of opportunity to study humans through their online traces. I will discuss three aspects of my research, which aims to model and understand people's behavior online. First, I will develop rich models of opinions by combining structured data (such as ratings) with unstructured data (such as text). Second, I will describe how preferences and behavior evolve over time, in order to characterize the process by which people &quot;acquire tastes&quot; for products such as beer and wine. Finally, I will discuss how people organize their personal social networks into communities with common interests and interactions. These lines of research require models that are capable of handling high-dimensional, interdependent, and time-evolving data, in order to gain insights into how humans behave.

<br />
<br /> This talk will address the research challenge of time-, energy-, and precision-efficient computation in embedded systems, with application to in-situ sensor data analytics. The talk will present theoretical results augmented by empirical data, to provide a deeper understanding of the tradeoff between time- and energy-efficiency through the use of parallelism, and how these tradeoffs are influenced by semiconductor-device and system-architectural properties. The insight gained from this analysis will be used to motivate two generations of embedded multiprocessor platforms developed to enable research in tradeoffs between energy-efficiency, performance, and tolerance to imprecision in computation and communication.

<br />
<br /> In this contribution I will highlight our recent efforts to impart functionality in “soft”, i.e. organic or polymeric interfacial architectures by means of controlling chemical patterns, topographic structures, shape and finally properties on micrometer to nanometer length scales.
<br />
<br /> The presentation will introduce in the first part the underlying concepts of nanopatterning and nanostructuring of polymers by placing established techniques and approaches as well as recently developed state of the art into proper context. Serial and parallel patterning techniques will receive attention and the advantages and limitations of selected examples of direct patterning methodologies, such as nanoimprint lithography, combined top-down - bottom-up approaches,
<em>1</em> and monolayer-based approaches like nanocontact printing
<em>2 </em>that are subsequently amplified by growing polymer brushes will be discussed.
<em>3</em>
<br />
<br /> In the second part our research into functional interfaces and the control of structure and properties on nanometer length scales will be addressed, in particular, template replication approaches for the fabrication of nanostructures, which exceed the size range of molecules and self-assembly approaches, by faithful 1 : 1 replication. In this context we have developed new approaches to shape pores formed during anodization of Al by temperature modulation.
<em>4</em> The resulting pores, which possess modulated diameters along their length, have been successfully replicated using e.g. layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes, resulting in novel, functional nanostructures, yielding the first example of complex structures by LBL that possess both concave and convex curvature.
<em>5,6 </em>In addition, polymer surface modification by means of reactive microcontact printing
<em>7</em> and scanning probe lithographic methods
<em>8</em> will be shown to provide access to highly controlled functional interfaces, e.g. to be applied in bacteria responsive coatings.

<em>Un homme revient dans sa campagne d'origine pour l'enterrement de sa grand-m&egrave;re. Il vient avec sa fille. De ce retour aux terres originelles, se m&ecirc;lent les envies du temps pr&eacute;sent, les frayeurs d'antan.<br /> C'est un voyage dans les temps que nous propose Didier-Georges Gabily, dans une langue formidablement belle. Une histoire d'amour et de d&eacute;sirs d'un p&egrave;re pour sa grand-m&egrave;re d&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;e et sa fille bien vivante, un trouble entre fantasme et r&eacute;alit&eacute;, une fuite en avant vers le souvenir. Le texte est construit comme si la t&ecirc;te ne pouvait penser qu'&agrave; une seule chose &agrave; la fois, en la figeant unanimement. C'est un regard distanci&eacute; au pr&eacute;sent sur une aventure pass&eacute;e... On y trouve tout ce qui fait trace dans l'oreille d'un enfant, tout ce qui fait trace dans l'oeil d'un p&egrave;re, tout ce qui fait trace dans le coeur d'un &ecirc;tre qui quitte et abandonne.</em>

<em>Farce grotesque, Yvonne, princesse de Bourgogne est une sorte de parodie shakespearienne. H&eacute;ritier du tr&ocirc;ne, le prince Philippe projette d’&eacute;pouser par d&eacute;fi des conventions, Yvonne, une fille d&eacute;pourvue de charme, insignifiante et ennuyeuse. L’arriv&eacute;e de cette princesse &laquo; hors norme &raquo; va bouleverser les codes et les valeurs de la cour. Par sa seule pr&eacute;sence, elle &eacute;veille au sein du royaume, agressivit&eacute; et haine en mettant &agrave; nu les failles et les vices de tout en chacun.

Comme un geste de r&eacute;bellion, joyeux et vivifiant, qui revendique son immaturit&eacute; et sa jeunesse, elle se joue des formes, flirte avec plusieurs styles, le clown, l’absurde, la com&eacute;die de mœurs, la trag&eacute;die.</em>

<a href=""http://annerochat.tumblr.com/"">Anne Rochat</a> presents her art on EPFL’s campus. A hybrid orchard is created through the fusion of different kinds of woods. Potted, it becomes a nomad. Artist Anne Rochat will display her orchard like a sculpture in some of the RLC’s patios. Twice, she will stage a performance with the trees, which will be both a decorative prop and an actor. Anne Rochat’s performances will invite you to marvel.

<br />
<strong>Robert Bolognesi</strong> has been studying snow and avalanches since 1981. He earned his doctorate in EPFL’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LIA). In 1992, he was hired as a researcher by the Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos. In 1999, he founded METEORISK, where he continues to pursue his scientific work. He takes photographs both out of necessity, for his research, and out of passion.
