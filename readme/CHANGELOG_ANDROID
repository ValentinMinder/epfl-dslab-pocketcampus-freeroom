0.3.22:
- NEW: QAForum plugin
Brought to you by the Artificial Intelligence Lab (LIA), QAForum provides a platform where you can freely ask questions, especially about campus life at EPFL. Your question will be intelligently forwarded to some of your colleagues. They will be selected based on the likelihood that they will be able to provide relevant answers. The community will also need your help in answering questions. There must be something Google doesn't know, but you do. Join us!
