 *************************** ANDROID & SERVER ***************************

 ========================================================================

In order to write a plugin for PocketCampus one should first understand its
architecture. The diagram above shows the plugin-oriented client-server
architecture.

PocketCampus is a platform for mobile app development that seamlessly provides a
number of services.

A set of features implemented on top of PocketCampus is called a PocketCampus 
plugin. Moodle, Camipro, and News are example of plugins in PocketCampus. 
Usually (but not always) a plugin has an icon on the dashboard. Exceptions are 
the authentication plugin and the dashboard itself, which is a plugin.

PocketCampus is a split-application, meaning it has a server-side code and a 
client-side code. Subsequently, each plugin should typically have its 
corresponding server-side and a client-side code. The communication between 
client and server is handled by the thrift framework. Thrift is a kind of 
multi-platform RPC technology. You can read more about it on the website 
thrift.apache.org.

The PocketCampus server is a kind of universal proxy. It has a crucial role 
since it unifies the communication between the different phones and different 
service providers. EPFL offers many IT services, which unfortunately speak 
different protocols. This introduces a big mess if we were to talk to them 
directly from each mobile platform. On the one hand, the PocketCampus server can 
talk to each and every service provider using its own language/protocol; and on 
the other hand, it can communicate with the different phones (Androids, iOSes, 
HTML5, etc) using the thrift protocol.

Normally all communication performed by the PocketCampus application should go 
through the PocketCampus server. The latter is the application’s gateway to the 
whole world. The one and only exception exists in the authentication plugin, 
which, for security reasons, sends the user credentials (username and password) 
directly to Tequila over HTTPS in order to authenticate a Tequila token/key.

PocketCampus plugins can be executed as standalone applications, both 
server-side and client-side. You just have to reference the PocketCampus SDK as 
a library. The PocketCampus SDK is a set of Java and Android projects that let’s 
you develop a plugin for PocketCampus. The PocketCampus SDK consists of exactly 
three projects: platform.sdk.android platform.sdk.server and 
platform.sdk.shared, which respectively contain the android code, the server 
code, and the code that needs to be shared between the client and the server.

To develop a PocketCampus plugin you should create three new projects: the 
android, the server, and the shared projects. You should reference the SDK 
projects from your newly created project. The plugins are self contained. By 
creating those three projects you have created an Android app (consisting of a 
single plugin) that you can install on your phone, and a server program (also 
consisting of a single plugin) that you can run locally on your machine. This 
technique (running a standalone plugin) is heavily used for development purposes 
as it simplifies the process, since you don’t have to care about other plugins 
while you’re developing your own plugin. For your newly created plugin to work 
you need to have a config file on your sdcard that overrides the internal config 
of the app in order to make the mobile app connect to your own instance of the 
server. This file should be named pocketcampus.config and it sits on the root of 
the sdcard. Contact me if you want a sample config file.

To simplify the task of creating a new plugin, I have written a script that 
creates a empty plugin for you out of a template. Basically the script copies 
the directory and files from the directory of the “blank” plugin to the 
directory of your newly created plugin. This script is in the tool.plugincreator 
folder you have to edit it to write the name of your new plugin.

Below I will go into the step-by-step details of how to create and develop a 
plugin for PocketCampus:

 1. Get the PocketCampus code
 2. Import the 3 SDK projects to Eclipse
 3. Edit the plugin creator script to set the name of your new plugin, and run 
    it to create the plugin skeleton 
 4. Write the thrift definition file for your own plugin, put the file in the 
    def diretory of your plugin's shared project, then edit and run the thrift 
    compiler script to generate the thrift objects and classes.
 5. Write your code, and run your app
 6. It is that easy!

At the end if you want to build a full PocketCampus with your own plugin inside, 
you have to edit the merger script and add your plugin name to the list of 
plugins to merge. Then by running the merger scripts, they will generate 2 
projects for you: one for the android app and the other for the server. By 
running ant inside those projects you get the android apk file and the server 
jar file, respectively. You can read the README_MERGE_AND_BUILD file in the root 
directory for more info.


 ********************************* IOS *********************************

 =======================================================================

The plugin creation for iOS clients is a bit different than on Android. The 
PocketCampus app is made of one Xcode project. The classes and files 
architecture is however well defined. It is mainly based on the pattern 
Model-View-Controller (MVC).

From repository's root, the Xcode project is located in: ios/PocketCampus
The plugins are logically stored in the Plugins folder, and the naming 
convention is <PluginName>Plugin.

Within each plugin's folder, there is standard folders structure:

 * Controllers: this folder contains all the controllers, with at least the 
   <PluginName>Controller class that is a subclass of PluginController.This 
   class is the main gate to the plugin from the app core and other plugins.
 * Model: this folder contains all the model classes and the Thrift services and 
   types (in the ThriftTypes+Services subfolder). You may also add here utility 
   classes, like <PluginName>Utils.
 * Views: this folder contains all classes and elements that directly represent 
   user interface elements. (Subclasses of UIView, XIBs, PNG, ...)

To facilitate the creation of new plugins, a script create_plugin.py that 
creates the above structure and skeletons classes is provided. It is located in 
ios->iphone->Tools->PluginCreator.

 1. cd into the PluginCreator folder
 2. Run "python create_plugin.py PluginName". PluginName should be in CamelCase.
    This will create a folder <PluginName>Plugin into 
    ios/PocketCampus/Plugins
 3. At that point, put the Thrift Objective-C generated files into 
    ios/iphone/PocketCampus/Plugins/<PluginName>Plugin/Model/ThriftTypes+Services/
 4. Still from the PluginCreator folder, run "python add_plugin_to_xcode.py ../../PocketCampus/Plugins/<PluginName>Plugin"
    This will add the plugin to the Xcode project.


At this point, the plugin has been added to Xcode. There are still a few steps 
to complete to finish the integration.

 1. Localize strings file: All strings of the UI should be localized in french 
    and english and put in strings files. By default, the created structure 
    comes with one .strings file for english language. To make this file 
    recognized as a localized file, select it in Xcode, and click on "Make 
    localized" button in the right column. To add french localization, simply 
    check it.
 2. Complete <PluginName>Controller and <PluginName>Service classes
 3. If needed, put plugin's icon with name <PluginName>.png and 
    <PluginName>@2x.png (Retina icon) into Views/Images/
 4. Last but not least, add an entry for the plugin in 
    PocketCampus/Plugins.plist (Supporting Files group). To do so, copy past a 
    row and under pluginIdentifier put <PluginName>
