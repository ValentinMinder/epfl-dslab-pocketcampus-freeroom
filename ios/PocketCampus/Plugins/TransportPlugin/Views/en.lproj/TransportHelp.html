	Transport schedules in PocketCampus are based on a very simple idea, that allows you to <b>see next departures very quickly</b>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
		<li>You first define the transport stations you often pass by. For example: EPFL and the closest station to your home. By default, EPFL and Lausanne-Flon (M1) are proposed.</li>
		<li>PocketCampus will then automatically select every time the <b>nearest station as departure</b> and show the <b>next departures <i>to</i> all your other stations</b>.<br>You can also choose the departure station <b>manually</b> by tapping the "From:" in the top bar.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Manage your stations</h2>
	To manage your stations, tap the<br>"list button" (bottom-right corner).<br>There, you can add, remove and reorder your stations.
    <h2>Location error</h2>
    If your current location cannot be determined or if you have denied its access, the nearest departure station feature is not available.<br>You can enable this feature by authorizing "EPFL" to access your location in Settings > Privacy > Location.<br>Your location is never sent to a server and is only used to determine the nearest station among your stations.
