 * PluginController for plugins that require a tequila authentication should subclass PluginControllerAuthentified.
 * This class provides a way to manage authentication using the observer pattern.
 * For example, if both class A and B of plugin P require the user to authenticate, they can both add themselves
 * as observers, so that when authentication finishes for the plugin, the code-blocks they gave as parameters are be executed.
 * See MoodleController for an example.

 * This superclass method will add the observer to the observers list and instanciate the iVar authController.
 * Observers are uniquely identified by combination of observer address and operationIdentifier.
 * For practicity, observers are removed when any of the events occur (success, userCancelled, failure), i.e. cleanAndNotify* methods are called
 * IMPORTANT: plugins MUST override this method and call super. Typically, start request for tequila token on plugin's service.
 * See MoodleController for an example.
