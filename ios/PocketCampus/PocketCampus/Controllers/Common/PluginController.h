 * viewControllerForURLQueryAction:parameters:
 * Implement this method to support returning a view controller directly from the action.
 * This method is typically used internally to PocketCampus, between plugins.

 * handleURLQueryAction:parameters:
 * Implement this method to support getting actions and parameters being passed to the plugin
 * controller when the app is opened with a URL.
 * You can assume that your plugin is already getting foreground (no need to request it).
 * Should return YES if action was successfully handled, NO otherwise.
