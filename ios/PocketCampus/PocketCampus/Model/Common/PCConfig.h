/*
 * PocketCampus configuration
 *
 * Configuration is of the form key-value.
 *
 * Values are populated into the defaults [PCConfig defaults] in the follow order of *overriding* priority (i overrides i+1):
 *
 * 1. Key-values found in "Application Support/<bundle_identifier>/Config.plist" (for DEV purposes)
 * 2. Key-values fetched from server with address http://pocketcampus.epfl.ch/backend/get_config.php
 * 3. Server key-values persisted from previous fetch (2.) (persisted in Application Support/<bundle_identifier>/ConfigFromServer.plist)
 * 4. Key-values found in bundle file Config.plist
 *
 * First, keys from Config.plist are loaded, then from cached ConfigFromServer.plist overrides then,
 * then any key-value pair returned by the server overrides those and finally the ones in Application Support override those again.
