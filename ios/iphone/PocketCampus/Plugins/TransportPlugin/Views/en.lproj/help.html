	Transport schedules in PocketCampus are based on a very simple idea that helps you see next departures <b>very quickly</b>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
		<li>You define a list of <b>favorite transport stations</b>. For example EPFL and the closest station to your home. By default, EPFL and Lausanne-Flon are proposed.</li>
		<li>PocketCampus will then automatically select every time the nearest favorite station as departure and show the <b>next departures to <i>all</i> your <i>other</i> favorite stations</b>.<br>You can also choose the departure station manually among your favorite stations.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Manage your favorite stations</h4>
	To manage your favorite stations, touch the blue bookmarks button. From there, you can add, remove and reorder stations by touching the <b>Edit</b> button.
