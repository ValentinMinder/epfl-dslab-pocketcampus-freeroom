	Transport schedules in PocketCampus are based on a very simple idea that shows you <b>next departures very quickly</b>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
		<li>You first define the transport stations you often pass by. For example: EPFL and the closest station to your home. By default, EPFL and Lausanne-Flon are proposed.</li>
		<li>PocketCampus will then automatically select every time the <b>nearest station as departure</b> and show the <b>next departures <i>to</i> all other defined stations</b>.<br>You can also choose the departure station <b>manually</b> among your stations by touching the bookmarks button.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Manage your stations</h4>
	To manage your stations, tap the bookmarks button. From there, you can add, remove and reorder your stations.
    <h4>Location error</h4>
    This message is displayed if your current location cannot be determined or if you have denied its access.<br>You can correct this behavior by enabling « EPFL » to have access to your location in the Settings of your iPhone, under <i> Location services </i> (<i>Privacy</i> in iOS6).<br>Your location is never sent to a server and is only used to determine the nearest station among your stations. Once this task done, the location service is disabled to preserve your battery life.
